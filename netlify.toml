# Note: The backend Flask API (in /backend) needs to be deployed separately
# as Netlify doesn't support long-running Python servers. Options:
# - Deploy backend to Railway, Render, Heroku, or similar service
# - Update API_BASE_URL in src/services/*.service.ts to point to deployed backend
# - Or use Netlify Functions/Edge Functions (requires backend rewrite)
